# smFISH
Design smFISH probes (take into consideration target structure)
This is a work in progress, aiming to imrpove the design of efficient smFISH probes for RNA targets by considering the RNA secondary structure.
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Python 3.x.x with pandas, biopython == 1.83 (or earlier)
2. RNAstructure text interface version 6.5 (earlier versions do not work! and please see installation notes for PinMol for help on how to configure this)
3. input file = "ct" format (containing MFE AND suboptimal structures)

CONSTRAINTS implemented ($ indicates thhat a constraint matches the one in the Biosearch Technologies smFISH probe design tool:
1. $smFISH probe length = 20 nucleotides
2. $smFISH probe GC content is between 45 and 60%
3. $two or more nucleotides difference between regions targeted by smFISH probes
4. target region = full length (note: CDS is more commonly used to maximize signal when more than one mRNA variant is expressed) - check carefully if the probes match the mRNA variant(s) of interest
5. it takes into account the minimum fee energy (MFE) AND sub-optimal structures predicted using an energy minimization algorithm such as RNAstructure by Dave Mathews at the University of Rochester.
6. manual probe selection may be required if CDS only is targeted or not enough probes are selected (48 recommended) when using these constraints
